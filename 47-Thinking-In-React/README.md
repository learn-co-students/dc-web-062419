Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
Step 2: Build A Static Version in React
Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live
Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow //Build your app

### Let's make an app from scratch
X User can see all pokemon
X User can add pokemon to their team (up to 6) by clicking
  X User can't add same pokemon twice
X User can remove pokemon from their team by clicking
 
X User can create a new Pokemon

Stretch
- User can search by pokemon name
- delete button will remove all pokemon from list
